        Guinea Pigs are cute little rodents that have found homes as popular American pets! They are relatively small, only about twice the size of a hamster, <br>
        but are packed full of adorable features! Many are used in class rooms because of their docile nature to teach kids how to handle a pet. They are also <br>
        much more durable than their hamster counter-parts! Their diets consist mainly of leaves and vegetables. Alfalfa hay is a favorite! Guinea pigs are sure <br>
        to make excellent pets for any household!
